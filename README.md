# to-do-list-docker
This project automates the building of Docker images according to the instructions in the docker-compose.yml file. The services are managed by Docker Compose, which simplifies the development and deployment process.

It also allows services to be started, although I ran into a problem when starting the project on port 3000, with the error message: "backend_1 | Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, stat '/frontend/build/index.html'".

Despite several attempts to solve this problem and finish the dockerisation of the project I have not managed to solve it yet.
